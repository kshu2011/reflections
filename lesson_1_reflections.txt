How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It helps filter out all the other lines that are the same and displays the lines that have differences.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Can always review changes that are made and better compare/debug code as the code progresses.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically savd, like Google Docs does?
Pros: will have control over each version and there would not be extra versions saved unnecassarily
Cons: May forget to save the version. 



Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git is a version control system catered towards programmers where multiple files generally make up a program. Whereas google docs deals more with regular documents and they tend to be separate entities.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log will display all the different versions of files that’s been created
git diff can compare any two files and show the differences

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Version control provides an easy way to revert back to previous versions, so this eliminates risk of making wrong changes, since can always revert back easily.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Try it out on my code.
